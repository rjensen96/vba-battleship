# vba-battleship
## Classic battleship, built entirely in Excel using VBA.

### Why I did this

True, but I'm not a programmer--I'm an accountant, and I want to show accountants that they can probably do more in Excel than they think.

I started this project as something to keep my mind interested while trying to survive some stuffy technical accounting classes. It was a fun exercise.

Overall, I think the bot performs fairly well. I ran a simulation of 1,000 games, and it took the bot an average of 51 moves to win (although it did win in as few as 23 moves). Are my algorithms perfect? Certainly not. 
### Why this is here

I'm posting this here mostly as a work sample. If you wanna try it out, go for it! I probably won't touch this much down the line. It was a just-for-fun project.

### Check out this guy

Nick Berry is a rocket scientist in the UK, and he just might have [the greatest Battleship algorithm](http://www.datagenetics.com/blog/december32011/index.html) the world will ever know. Good job, Nick. My bot isn't as cool as yours, but I had fun trying.
